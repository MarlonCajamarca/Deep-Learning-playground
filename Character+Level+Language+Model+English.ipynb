    "\n",
    "- Algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of the training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end one could see dinosaur names with cool endings. \n",
    "- **Further work**: run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results.\n",
    "- Implemetation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. \n",
    "- Model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.\n",
    "- Model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! \n",
    "- Used a relatively small dataset, so that you could train an RNN quickly on a CPU. \n",
    "- Training a model of the english language requires a much bigger dataset, and usually needs much more computation, and could run for many hours on GPUs."
